# terminal-weather
 ‚õÖ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ö°üåß weather client for the terminal

### Installation 

Install with `pip` for your ease:

```shell
$ pip install weathernow
```

or make git clone.

### Usage

As the OpenWeatherMap API needs a valid API key to allow responses, you must get your own API key and replace "xxx" in `weather.py` (lines 38 & 39) by your API key.
You can signup for a free API key [on the OWM website](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)

### Run 

```shell
$ python3 weather.py <cityname>
```

Here's example for Paris, FR
